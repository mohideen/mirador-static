Those who fail to\nreport will have to forfeit the privi-\nlege of having their pictures in the\nbook, and will be compelled to pay\ntlie price of having the pictures;\ntaken.\nParks Shipley, editor of the Re-\nveille, gives out the glad news that\na greater part of the written ma-\nterial has been turned in and that\nthe book is well in hand. The art\nJdepartment has funished most of\nits work having only a few more!\ndrawings to complete.\nGeorge Morrison, business man-\nager, has awarded the contract for\nprinting the 1926 Reveille to Horn\nand Shaffer Company of Baltimore..\nThis company printed the book last,\nyear. Having issued most of the\ncontracts, he is pressed for ready\ncash and wants all out standing,\npublication fees to be paid imme-\ndiately.\nU. of M. \nKenneth Cole, ’l4, is the happiest\nman in Port Chester, N.
