As\nthe Sophs failed to make their ap-\npearance upon the battlefield, the\nFreshmen proceeded to round them\nup.\nMany members of the Sophomore\nclass were forced to taste the snow\nin front of Calvert Hall and divers\nother places. It is the expressed\nopinion of Carl Neunan and King\nWard that the present Freshman\nclass is the best they have seen and\nMit Collins claims acquaintance\nwith every snowflake on the hill.\nCharlie extends his thanks to the\nFreshmen for the barber bill\nwhich Andy Gump, who later gave\nan exhibition of his speed, ran up\nin his desire to escape the “rats.”\n"
