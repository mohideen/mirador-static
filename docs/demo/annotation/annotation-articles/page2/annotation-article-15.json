In fact, if all\nthe gridmen tried to follow Mike’s\nlead, Coach Curley Byrd doubtless\nwould have to call a halt or his\nplayers soon would be ragged.\nMike bespoke the stuff of which\nhe is made when he said at the ban-\nquet: “With all the backfield ma-\nterial that will be left from this\nseason’s team and that coming up\nfrom the Freshmen eleven it ap-\npears to me as if the captain would\nbe warming the bench most of the\ntime.”\nHowever, if Curly can develop\nenough backs to keep Mike on the\nbench, he will have a mighty sweet\narray of ball carriers. But at any\nrate. Mike showed that he is the\nkind of a fellow who would willing-\nly sit on the side lines if there is a\nbetter man to fill his shoes. That’s\nthe real spirit.\nU. of M. \n"
